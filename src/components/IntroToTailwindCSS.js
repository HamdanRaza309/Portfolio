                    TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that has revolutionized the way we approach styling in web development. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide pre-designed components, TailwindCSS offers a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to build custom designs quickly and efficiently. In this blog, we will explore the fundamentals of TailwindCSS, its advantages, and how you can leverage it to streamline your styling process.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is TailwindCSS?</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that emphasizes using utility classes to build custom designs directly in your HTML. This approach allows for rapid prototyping and reduces the need for writing custom CSS. Instead of defining styles in separate CSS files, you apply utility classes directly to your HTML elements.

                        <strong>Utility-First Approach:</strong>
                        <p>TailwindCSS provides utility classes for common CSS properties such as margins, padding, colors, and typography. For example, instead of writing custom CSS for margin and padding, you use utility classes like <code>mt-4</code> or <code>p-6</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
                        <p>TailwindCSS includes responsive utilities that make it easy to design for different screen sizes. You can apply different utility classes at various breakpoints using prefixes like <code>sm:</code>, <code>md:</code>, and <code>lg:</code>.</p>
                    </li>

                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-lg">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Install TailwindCSS:</strong>
                        <p>Use npm or yarn to install TailwindCSS:</p>
                        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
                            {`npm install tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init`}
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Configure TailwindCSS:</strong>
                        <p>Create a <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file and configure your theme, variants, and plugins. TailwindCSS provides a default configuration that you can customize:</p>
                        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
                            {`module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}`}
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Add Tailwind to Your CSS:</strong>
                        <p>Include the Tailwind directives in your main CSS file:</p>
                        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
                            {`@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;`}
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Build and Use Tailwind:</strong>
                        <p>Run the build process to generate the final CSS file. You can then include this file in your project and start using TailwindCSS classes in your HTML:</p>
                        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
                            {`npx tailwindcss -o build/tailwind.css --watch`}

                        <strong>Keep Your CSS Organized:</strong>
